What's next for MENTAL HEALTH ASSIST
For scaling our mental health chat bot on a big level we can do this two listed points :

1) opening vending machines which will be having our mental health chat bot and these machines can be placed either in a area where doctor help can not reach quickly and these vending machine can be placed outside clinics of doctors so the crowd can be controlled because they can consult there heath with chat bot

2) there are many mental health doctors who are specialized in there work but don't have any online presence due to which more patient cant find them so we will be hiring a team which work is to bringing are best doctor who don't have online presence to our app by which doctors can get new patient and patient can get consultation from expert
